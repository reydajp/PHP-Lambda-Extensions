# PHP-Lambda-Extensions
Extra extensions for [stackery's php layer for AWS lambda](https://github.com/stackery/php-lambda-layer).

As per the suggestion in the readme by stackery, the extension .so files are placed in `/lib/php/7.1/modules/`, so that they can be loaded together with the built-in extensions.
